Whether you're just starting your bootcamp journey or looking to level up your existing skills, mastering these five essential areas will give you a competitive edge in the job market."},{type:"heading",text:"1. Modern JavaScript Frameworks"},{type:"paragraph",text:"React, Vue, and Svelte continue to dominate the frontend landscape. But it's not just about knowing one framework—it's about understanding the underlying principles that make them work. Component-based architecture, state management, and reactive programming are concepts that transcend any single framework."},{type:"paragraph",text:"Focus on building real projects with these frameworks. The best way to learn is by doing, and employers want to see practical experience in your portfolio."},{type:"heading",text:"2. TypeScript and Type Safety"},{type:"paragraph",text:"TypeScript has become the industry standard for building scalable applications. It catches bugs before they reach production and makes your code more maintainable. If you're still writing vanilla JavaScript, now is the time to make the switch."},{type:"heading",text:"3.
